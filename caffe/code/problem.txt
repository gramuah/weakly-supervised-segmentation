Check failed: outer_num_ * inner_num_ * 3 == bottom[1]->count(0) (5043 vs. 1681) 
Number of labels must match the number of predictions because there are three channels, 
one for gt labels per pixel and one for objectness labels per pixel and one for unique classes; 
e.g., if softmax axis == 1 and prediction shape is (N, C, H, W), label count (number of labels) must be 3*N*H*W, with integer values in {0, 1, ..., C-1}.
