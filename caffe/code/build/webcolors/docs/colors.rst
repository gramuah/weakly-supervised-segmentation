.. _colors:


An overview of colors on the Web
================================

Colors on the Web are typically specified in `the sRGB color space`_,
where each color is made up of a red component, a green component and
a blue component. This maps to the red, green and blue components of
the pixels on a computer display, and to the three sets of cone cells
in the human eye, which respond to (roughly) the wavelengths of light
associated with red, green and blue.

On the Web, sRGB colors are specified in formats which describe the
color as a 24-bit integer, where the first 8 bits provide the red
value, the second 8 bits the green value and the final 8 bits the blue
value. This gives a total space of 256 * 256 * 256 or 16,777,216
unique colors, though due to differences in display technology not all
of these colors may be clearly distinguishable on any given physical
display.


HTML 4
------

HTML 4 defined `two ways to specify sRGB colors`_:

* The character ``#`` followed by three pairs of hexdecimal digits,
  specifying values for red, green and blue components in that order;
  for example, ``#0099cc``.

* A set of predefined color names which correspond to specific
  hexadecimal values; for example, ``blue``. HTML 4 defines sixteen
  such colors.


CSS 1
-----

In `its description of color units`_, CSS 1 added
three new ways to specify sRGB colors:

* The character ``#`` followed by three hexadecimal digits, which is
  expanded into three hexadecimal pairs by repeating each digit; thus
  ``#09c`` is equivalent to ``#0099cc``.

* The string ``rgb``, followed by parentheses, between which are three
  base-10 integers in the range 0..255, which are taken
  to be the values of the red, green and blue components in that
  order; for example, ``rgb(0, 153, 204)``.

* The same as above, except using percentages instead of numeric
  values; for example, ``rgb(0%, 60%, 80%)``.

CSS 1 also suggested a set of sixteen color names. These names were
identical to the set defined in HTML 4, but CSS 1 did not provide
definitions of their values and stated that they were taken from "the
Windows VGA palette".


CSS 2
-----

In its `section on colors`_, CSS 2 allowed the same methods of
specifying colors as CSS 1, and defined and provided values for
sixteen named colors, identical to the set found in HTML 4.

CSS 2 also specified `a list of names of system colors`_. These had no
fixed color values, but would take on values from the operating system
or other user interface, and allowed elements to be styled using the
same colors as the surrounding user interface. These names are
deprecated as of CSS 3.

The CSS 2.1 revision did not add any new methods of specifying sRGB
colors, but did define `one additional named color`_: ``orange``.


CSS 3
-----

`The CSS 3 color module`_ adds one new way to specify colors:

* A hue-saturation-lightness triplet (HSL), using the construct
  ``hsl()``.

CSS 3 also adds support for variable opacity of colors, by allowing
the specification of alpha-channel information through the ``rgba()``
and ``hsla()`` constructs. These are used similarly to the ``rgb()``
and ``hsl()`` constructs, except a fourth value is supplied indicating
the level of opacity from ``0.0`` (completely transparent) to ``1.0``
(completely opaque). Though not technically a color, the keyword
``transparent`` is also made available in lieu of a color value, and
corresponds to ``rgba(0,0,0,0)``.

CSS 3 also defines a new set of 147 color names. This set is taken
directly from `the named colors defined for SVG (Scalable Vector
Graphics)`_ markup, and is a superset of the named colors defined in
CSS 2.1.


HTML5
-----

HTML5 exists in two forms: a living document maintained by WHATWG, and
a W3C Recommendation. The two HTML5 documents, as of this writing,
share a common definition of color values and parsing, and formalize
the parsing and serialization of colors according to prior standards
and real-world implementations in Web browsers.

HTML5 does not introduce any new methods of specifying colors, but
does simplify the description of colors and introduce useful
terminology.

* A set of three 8-bit numbers representing the red, blue and green
  components of an sRGB color is termed a "simple color".

* A seven-character string which begins with the character ``#``,
  followed by six ASCII hex digits (i.e., ``A-Fa-f0-9``), representing
  the red, green and blue components of an sRGB color, is a "valid
  simple color".

* A valid simple color expressed with only lowercase ASCII hex digits
  (i.e., ``a-f0-9``) is a "valid lowercase simple color".

HTML5 provides three algorithms related to colors:

1. An algorithm for parsing simple color values, which works on any
   string that is a valid simple color as defined above.

2. An algorithm for serializing simple color values, which will always
   produce a valid lowercase simple color.

3. A legacy color-parsing algorithm, which will yield a valid simple
   color from a variety of inputs, including inputs which are valid
   simple colors, inputs which are valid for formats from other
   standards, and certain types of "junk" inputs which were common in
   real-world documents.

The HTML5 legacy parsing algorithm does not support the non-color
keyword ``transparent`` from CSS 3 and will produce an error for that
input. It also does not recognize the CSS 2 "system color" keywords;
it will convert each such keyword to simple color, consistently, but
in a way which does not follow CSS 2's definitions of these keywords
(which itself was system- and configuration-dependent).

The implementations in this module are based on the definitions and
algorithms of `the W3C HTML5 Recommendation's section on colors`_.

What this module supports
-------------------------

The ``webcolors`` module supports the following methods of specifying
sRGB colors, and conversions between them:

* Six-digit hexadecimal.

* Three-digit hexadecimal.

* Integer ``rgb()`` triplet.

* Percentage ``rgb()`` triplet.

* Varying selections of predefined color names.

The ``webcolors`` module **does not support**:

* The CSS 1 named colors, which did not have defined values.

* The CSS 2 system colors, which did not have fixed values.

* The ``transparent`` keyword, which denotes an effective lack of
  color.

* Opacity/alpha-channel information specified via ``rgba()`` triplets.

* Colors specified in the HSL color space, via ``hsl()`` or ``hsla()``
  triplets.

If you need to convert between sRGB-specified colors and HSL-specified
colors, or colors specified via other means, consult `the colorsys
module`_ in the Python standard library, which can perform conversions
amongst several common color systems.
